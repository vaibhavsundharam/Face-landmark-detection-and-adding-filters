# Face-landmark-detection-and-adiing-filters
In this project we use pythons dlib library to find 68 key-points on a face and apply filters to the detected face. One can extend this to a live face as well. 
The link to the shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file can be found on this [page](https://towardsdatascience.com/facial-mapping-landmarks-with-dlib-python-160abcf7d672).
